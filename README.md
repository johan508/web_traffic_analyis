# web_traffic_analyis

I donâ€™t have an accurate number to prove but based on my past experiences, online marketing nowadays seems more economical and efficient than conventional marketing schemes, such as TV commercials. Imagine if I have a website (I do have one) or an online store, with the help of digital (web traffic) analytics I can answer three questions in no time:    
1.	Who are my visitors (and how many)? (Acquisition)   
2.	What do they do on my website (and how many)? (Behaviour)  
3.	Who became my customers eventually (and the ratio)? (Conversion)  

In this project, I will deploy this funnel process in Google Analytics on my personal website (https://zhanghan.ca). Since there is neither product page nor sales page on my web, the data collected for the last step (conversion) will probably be none.
