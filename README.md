# web_traffic_analyis

I donâ€™t have an accurate number to prove but based on my past experiences, online marketing nowadays seems more economical and efficient than conventional marketing schemes, such as TV commercials. Imagine if I have a website (I do have one) or an online store, with the help of digital (web traffic) analytics I can answer three questions in no time:    
1.	Who are my visitors (and how many)? (Acquisition)   
2.	What do they do on my website (and how many)? (Behaviour)  
3.	Who became my customers eventually (and the ratio)? (Conversion)
